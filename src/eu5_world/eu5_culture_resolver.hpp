// Decides what a CK3 culture means in EU5 terms.
//
// EU5 is roughly ten times more granular than CK3: there is no german culture, there are twenty
// seven of them. So a one to one mapping cannot be written, and flattening Westphalia, Swabia and
// the Palatinate into a single "german" would lose more than it converts.
//
// Instead EU5's own culture is kept wherever CK3 has nothing finer to say - that is, wherever the
// EU5 culture already belongs to a group or speaks a language the CK3 culture maps onto. Only land
// where the two genuinely disagree, because the player moved a culture somewhere it does not
// belong, is overwritten. Where CK3's culture has no EU5 equivalent at all - norse, and every
// hybrid or divergent culture a campaign invents - a definition is generated so it keeps its name
// rather than being forced into the nearest stranger.
